<h1 style="text-align:center">Welcome to the CURRENT_YEAR CTF_NAME CTF!</h1>
<h4 style="text-align:center">Open from START_TIME until END_TIME </h4>

<!-- This **Capture the Flag (CTF)** is open for everyone to compete in. However, **prizes are limited** to the top three highest-scoring UNSW students entering first year in CURRENT_YEAR. -->

## Capture the Flag? But what even is a flag?

Think of a Capture the Flag as a ✨ cyber scavenger hunt ✨. There's a series of challenges for you to solve, and each of them will reward you with a 'flag' once you've solved it. You can submit these flags for points! For this CTF, flags will look like this, unless otherwise specified:

`CTF_NAME{y0ur_f1r5t_fl4g}`

## I have never written a line of code, let alone 'hacked' before. Is there something for me?

Yes! This CTF is designed to focus more on getting you into a security mindset, rather than flexing technical knowledge (although there are a _few_ opportunities for that). All challenges worth 50 points or less (of which there are many!!) are _specifically_ designed to reward aspects such as critical thinking and being observant :). You won't need to know how to use a command line, or have written a line of code before to solve them.

<!-- NOTE: uncomment if there are in-person challenges involved -->
<!-- ## Star challenges -->
<!-- Some challenges have a star (*) on the end of their name. These challenges require you to be at our O-Week stall to solve them. You can find us there on **Tuesday to Thursday, 10am to 4pm** of O-Week at the west side of the **Alumni Lawn**. -->

## But first, some rules.

There's a security lecturer at UNSW, Professor Richard Buckland, who sets out a Good Faith Policy, expecting students to be good citizens, not damage others' property, annoy other people, and do things which you know others might not be happy about, and act in good faith in general.

Just like Richard Buckland, we expect you to act in good faith. We also expect you to follow these specific rules.

1. **Don't brute force.** That is, don't spam the server with flag attempts, or other requests.
2. **Don't break the infrastructure.** Any attempt to hack or cause damage to the CTF platform just makes it less fun for everyone.
3. **Don't share flags with other people!** Keep things enjoyable and fair. :)
4. **Don't hoard flags** (i.e. waiting to submit them all at once). This can be discouraging to other players and makes it harder to identify cheaters.
