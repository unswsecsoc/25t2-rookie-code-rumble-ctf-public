I heard rumours that UNSW CSE's education committee recently approved the new Software Project Management course in February to run, starting next year! I can't wait to chat to other keen students about the course in CSESoc's Discord server.

### The Big Idea

The CSE Education Committee has all meeting minutes [here](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~teachadmin/tc/index.html), so we can find the new course proposed on the February meeting minutes document and join the course chat in the CSESoc discord channel using its bot.

### Walkthrough

1. Visit https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~teachadmin/tc/index.html.
2. Navigate to the `14 February 2025` meeting minutes hyperlink.
3. See under `4. ITEMS FOR DISCUSSION` that COMP9820 is the newly proposed course.
4. Visit the CSESoc Discord server and go to its [#course-chats channel](https://discord.com/channels/693779865916276746/860388285511630868).
5. Type `/course join COMP9820` and join the #comp9820 channel.
6. Retrieve the flag in the very first message posted to this channel.
