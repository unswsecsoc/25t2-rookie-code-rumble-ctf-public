Welcome to the CSESoc x DevSoc x SecSoc Rookie Code Rumble (Structs Edition)! We hope you've had fun hacking so far. **TWO** flags have been planted in Structs. Flag #2 is located in our newly released visualiser-debugger. 
To the No.1 fans of Structs, now the real deal has begin! 
For this challenge, you will need to complete the code in `ctf_linked_list.c` and visualise your code, which will reveal numbers which correspond to characters.
**Note:** These characters should be wrapped in the `RCR{}` flag format. For example, if you find the characters `eat_lasagna`, the flag should be `RCR{eat_lasagna}`.

### The Big Idea

After completing and visualising the code, the user should get the following linked list: 
`99 -> 108 -> 105 -> 99 -> 107 -> 95 -> 109 -> 101`
After decoding from HTML numbers, it should read `click_me`. The final flag will be `RCR{click_me}`.

### Walkthrough

As above.

### Flag(s)

- `RCR{click_me}`
