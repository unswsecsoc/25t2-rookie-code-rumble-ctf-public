  I saw that one of my friends posted online saying that "I can't believe my preferences align so closely with everyone else in Tasmania in this year's federal vote for the senate! My first 6 preferences completely aligned with the parties with the highest first preferences. I can't believe so many Tasmanians voted for Clive Palmers party though, my 7th preference was the shooters party."
  He cares about not sharing too much information online, but I'm worried he doesn't know that it is possible to view votes in many Australian elections with their vote location. What is the postcode of the polling place the friend voted at?
  **Note:** Your answer should be the postcode of the polling place the friend voted, you do not need to wrap your answer with `RCR{}`. For example, if you think the vote collection point is 2052, then supply `2052` as the flag.
