  This is my first time taking public transport but I don’t know which bus will take me home! I took a photo of the bus but some key information is missing 😔. Can you tell me the route number and name so I can get home safe?
  *Note*: Your answer should be the bus route of the bus in the picture, you do not need to wrap your answer with `RCR{}`. For example, if you think the route is 373, then supply `373` as the flag.
