Welcome to the Circles CTF challenge for the 2025 CSESoc/DevSoc/SecSoc CTF!!!
Your mission is to find two secret pieces of text. Combine them in order (Piece 1 then Piece 2) to form the final flag: `RCR{[Piece1][Piece2]}`.
For example, if the first piece is ICouldEatLike the second piece is 100McNuggets then the final flag is: `RCR{ICouldEatLike100McNuggets}``.
## Part 1: The Writing's on the Wall
The first piece of the flag is hiding in plain sight, almost on every page of circles. If you're careful and detail-oriented, you'll find it.
## Part 2: BOTS0101 - Stop Bots from taking our jobs
Today's tech landscape is a freaky one, with a lot of automation going around. Websites often have a guide for web crawlers (like Googlebot) telling them which areas to avoid. But you're not a web crawler, you're a human (surely), and you can totally avoid it for us.
