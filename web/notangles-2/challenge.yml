  The Notangles team is being extra secretive about new updates coming in T2. They have been hurredily testing some changes on their staging instance. You wonder if they left any secrets lying around whilst testing - surely data on their **accounts** would be impossible to reach right? ðŸ¤” Through a bit of OSINT, you find one of the director's zID - z5476247, probably worth noting down for later...
  **Note:** Since this is not the live version of Notangles, you do not need to worry about accidently viewing private data. It is not necessary to use brute force, but you may attempt to actively exploit the application. Obviously, please do not investigate the live version of Notangles.
